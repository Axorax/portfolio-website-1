Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Axorax.

I like to make websites, YouTube videos, games, music and more!
I enjoy studying science, programming and playing chess. I always appreciate feedback whether it is good or bad!

I am currently a student. I try my best to study and make content alongside. My favorite subjects are Physics, Biology, Mathematics, Chemistry and English. My dream is to become a doctor and a professional programmer. ðŸ˜Ž

Donations can help me make my content better and motivate me! Any donations are
highly appreciated. :D [https://patreon.com/axorax/]
